# Welcome to your skills assessment for Rootstrap

## Before you start:

1. Once you click the "Start the test" button, you will not be able to pause or retake the test. Make sure that you will not be interrupted.
2. If you exit your browser by accident, no worries. Use the invitation link to return to your assessment.
3. All answers will be saved when the time expires except code written for a programming task. You must explicitly save your code or build & run tests before the time runs out during programming tasks.
4. Before starting make sure you have installed everything necessary to build and run an Angular app (**Angular CLI: 11.1.2 Node: 12.18.3+** is needed to run the base project). Once you have, please download or clone the project to your machine. **Remember to upload** your solution **before the time is up**.
5. Check the [help](https://help.devskiller.com/) section before starting the assessment or find it in the top-right corner of the page during the test.

# Task description

## Introduction

For this exercise, youâ€™ll need to complete a simple Angular app that lists information while using an external public REST API. Time is limited, we know it, don't worry if you don't get to complete all the requirements.

Good luck!

## Requirements

1. Take a look at the code of the project, you will find some code-smells, architectonical issues, and some bad practices. Please make all the changes you consider are necessary to resolve these problems.

2. Create a new screen to show character details, this will be called from the current list when you click on a character image. The new screen will show characters image, name, gender, status, and species.

3. Now we ask you to change the way results are paginated, implement vertical-scroll pagination that replaces the current pagination behavior based on buttons.

## Nice to have:

Any visual or UI enhancement.

## API specification

In case you need to check any API detail you can go to [Rick & Morty public REST API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)
